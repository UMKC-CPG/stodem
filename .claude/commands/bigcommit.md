# Full Commit

Perform a thorough, documented commit. Follow each step in order.

**Step 1: Review all changes**

Run `git diff HEAD` to see all uncommitted changes. List the files and
the document level (VISION/ARCHITECTURE/DESIGN/PSEUDOCODE/CODE) for each.

**Step 2: Document propagation check**

For each changed source file or document:
- Check that dev/VISION.md, dev/ARCHITECTURE.md, dev/DESIGN.md and
  dev/PSEUDOCODE.md still accurately describe the system after all changes.
- Check that any completed TODO items are marked `- [x]` in dev/TODO.md.
- Check that any new design decisions are reflected in the appropriate
  document.
Report every inconsistency found. If any are found, pause and ask the
programmer to resolve them before proceeding.

**Step 3: Code quality check**

For each changed source file, verify:
- Lines are <= 80 characters, with 80 as the target, not a ceiling to
  stay well under -- lines shorter than necessary harm readability
- No unused imports or dead code remains
- Variable names are long and expressive, not abbreviated
- Non-obvious logic has explanatory comments
Report any violations. Fix minor issues (line length, trivial style)
inline. For substantive issues, stop and ask the programmer.

**Step 4: Confirm**

Present a brief summary of what will be committed and ask the programmer
to confirm.

**Step 5: Commit**

Stage and commit with a comprehensive message:
- First line: brief summary (imperative mood, <= 72 chars)
- Blank line
- Body: what changed, why, and which DESIGN.md sections are affected
- Blank line
- Include this trailer:

**Step 6: Report**

Report the commit hash and list any remaining open TODO items related
to the committed work.
